# Simple-Blockchain

This is an implementation of a simple blockchain build purely in Python 3.4
## Features
  * Calculating the hash of a block
  * Mine a block with pending Transactions
  * Distribution of mining rewards
  * Implementation of Proof of work algorithm
  * Validating the Blockchain


A block consists of information like, index, timestamp, data, and the value of previous hash.
Each block is stored in a list starting from the Genesis Block (which is the first block in the blockchain). 

## Libaries used
