# Simple-Blockchain

This is an implementation of a simple blockchain build purely in Python 3.4
This implementation contains following features -
**Calculating the hash of a block**
**Mine a block with pending Transactions**
**Distribution of mining rewards**
**Implementation of Proof of work algorithm**

and does not possess features like, distributed system and peer to peer networking.
A block consists of information like, index, timestamp, data, and the value of previous hash.
Each block is stored in a list starting from the Genesis Block (which is the first block in the blockchain). 
I have used python's "HASHLIB" library for hashing of the data.
